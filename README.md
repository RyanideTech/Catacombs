# Catacombs
A text-based RPG by Ryan S. H.

Awakening to darkness in an ancient cavern, hundrends of feet below the surface, 
you realize you can't remember who you are, or why you've come here.
Looking above you, you see a single source of light shining down, too distant to be of any use to your vision.

You've fallen into the Catacombs, a vast and long forgotten prison of forgotten magical beings, sealed centuries ago.
Using the resources you find around you, you'll navigate the tunnels to reach the only escape: a door to Upside. 
Guarded for centuries by magic beyond imagine, the journey to your freedom is rife with danger.
To escape, you must battle the prisoners of the Catacombs to retrive the Keystones, relics of emense magical power.
With them, you will have the strength to move about the five caverns of the Catacombs.
Only once you have collected all Keystones and defeated the ancient chamber guardians who stand in your way, can you return to your life in the Upside.

Do you have the strength to escape?
